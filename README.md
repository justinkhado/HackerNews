# HackerNews
The intent behind doing this project was to utilize the datetime module in Python to analyze posts from Hacker News, 
a reddit-like forum for tech discussion. The data used was retrieved from Kaggle and is linked to within the Jupyter
Notebook. The goal of the project, itself, was to determine what type of post and what time of creation of the post would 
generally garner more comments on the post.
